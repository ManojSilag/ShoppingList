#About App

This shoppingList app lets you add items to your list, so next time when you go shopping you don't forget anything.

You can simply enter Items in the list and click enter button on the screen or enter button of the keyboard (if using pc). The item gets added to your list.

If you want to remove the item from the list you can simply click the remove button that appears on the left of the item.

Once you are in shop or mall you don't want to get confused which item you have taken or not so to remove such confusion once you buy the item you can simply scratch the item from list by clicking on the item itself in the list for example if see in list that and there is Mozzarella cheese so you buy the Mozzarella cheese
and simply click on Mozzarella cheese on the list, Then 'M̶o̶z̶z̶a̶r̶e̶l̶l̶a̶ ̶c̶h̶e̶e̶s̶e̶ ' will be seen on the screen.
